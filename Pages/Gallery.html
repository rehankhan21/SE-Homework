              A couple of my buddies and me logged on too chess.com after watching the show and started playing eachother, Or atleast we attempted to play. I also started watching alot of Magnus Carlsen videos, and since he is the current world champion it was amazing to watch.
              I feel like Magnus is the real life equalient to Elizabeth Harmon. The only really sad thing about Queens Gambit, is that both the director and the actors all said they did not have any plans on continuing the show and renewing a second season. But I still have hope, 
              seeing as money talks, and not making a season 2 would be a wasted opportunity. I give Queens Gambit a 9.5 out of 10.

            <td><p>The Queen's Gambit is a 2020 American coming-of-age period drama miniseries based on Walter Tevis's 1983 novel of the same name. The title refers to "Queen's Gambit", a chess opening. 
              It was written and directed by Scott Frank, who created it with Allan Scott. Beginning in the mid-1950s and proceeding into the 1960s, the story follows the life of Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), 
              an orphaned chess prodigy on her rise to the top of the chess world while struggling with drug and alcohol dependency.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)">Source Wikipedia</a></p></td>

              Mad Men does a wounderful job at showing all the differences in world views between now and then. One example would be how the women were stuck as receptionist and only the men would be allowed in business meetings, but they also showed how this changed in time over many years.
              One of the things I loved the most about this show was the fashion. Everyone always looked like they were in charge of any situation just based on their attire alone. The classic suit played a huge part in the way one was perceived by others. I give Mad Men a 9 out of 10.

            <td><p>Mad Men begins at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City and later at the newly created firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (later named Sterling Cooper & Partners), 
              located near the Time-Life Building at 1271 Sixth Avenue. According to the pilot episode, the phrase "Mad men" was a slang term coined in the 1950s by advertisers working on Madison Avenue to refer to themselves, 
              "Mad" being short for "Madison". (In reality, the only documented use of the phrase from that time may have been in the late-1950s writings of James Kelly, an advertising executive and writer.)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men">Source Wikipedia</a></p></td>
