    Spring Boot

    XML configurations. Writing logic to get the workflow done.

    Spring Boot says, dont worry about the configuration, just focus on developing the app
    Spring Boot is layer that sits between the spring framework and the application.
    All those XML config settings are done by spring boot.

    Springboot makes your work faster now. When you installed spring boot. Its like when
    you create react app. it creates the framework for you. Samething spring boot does
    but on the serverside.

    Spring boot runs on annotations, so instead of using XML files we use annotations.

    Annotations are like comments but they actually get complied. Maven is build time tool.


    Java has 3 built in annotations.
    Spring Boot is better than Spring

    Spring tools ide

    test folder, we have unit testing code.

    Maven is a built tool, it help

    pom.XML is the config file that spring boot creates for us, so that 
    we dont have to do it with spring.

    @scope(value="prototype"), by default bean classes are sigleton
    pattern.

    @Component turns a normal java class into a spring boot bean
    class.
