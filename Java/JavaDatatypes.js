// Java is platform independent, doesnt matter what OS you are using, Java sends the byte code to
// JVM(java virtual machine)

// Java is a compile language, JS is an interperter language

// Java is a strong typed language, we have to write the type of the language when declaring a variable

// we will using ecipse as our Java IDE 

// when we compile our java code, it will turn from .java to .class, .class is the complied version for
// the computer, .class is our excutable program, we run the .class file when we want to see our program.

/*
    Two
    Primitive data types 
    Object data types

    Primitive data types:

    Int by defualt is 0, int is 32bit, int has a built in Integer class

    Long is 64 bit number, twice that of int

    Float holds decimal numbers and double holds twice the size of float, float has Float

    char one character '', char has Character class 

    boolean has Boolean class

    Object/Reference datatype

    String, we compare strings in Java differently, we have to use a method isEqual instead
    string is a built in class in java.
    Array

    these objects have properties and methods attached to them

    **Running Java Programs:

    jre is java runtime enverioment, jdk is java dev kit

    javac Hello.java creates the .class file exe
    java Hello runs the class file

    **eciplse:

    too write a function we need to write a class file
    we have to make a project first

    create java project
    JRE system libraray, kinda like node modules

    make class files in src folder, we create a new package, that holds
    our class files

    new class files in package folder

    class modifiers, public: any other class can access this classes
    methods and properties, package: only classes in the same package 
    can access its methods and properties

    method stubs, boilerplate, click public static void boilerplate
