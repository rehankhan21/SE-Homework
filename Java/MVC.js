    Spring MVC

    Model View Controller

    View -
    
    Controller - Business Logic, web XML  file that maps all the 
    logic with the request that are sent from user. Web.xml

    Model - Data Layer

   ** Spring boot created DispatcherServlet, takes the mapping in a more 
    effiecnt way, Adds an annotation to your controller called
    @Controller, this makes it easier to map each controller to
    your servlets in the view. 

    One Java file called service, creates the web.xml file that
    configs all the servlets with your controller classes for you.
