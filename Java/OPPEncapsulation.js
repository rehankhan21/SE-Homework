/*
    OOP Encapsulation

    -When we have a class and the class contains all the instance variables
    and instance methods. When everything is wrapped together. The user doesnt
    have direct acess to the data. You dont want the user to change the instance
    variables.

    Also known as data hiding. Declare these variables private. So that those 
    variables can only be seen by its own class. Read Only Data.

    **Make the setters and getters public so that other classes can read the 
    hidden private data,  while the instance variables are private.

    When ever we make an object take input from user.
