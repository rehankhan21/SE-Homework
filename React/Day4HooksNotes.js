    React Hooks

    React States are data that is stored and manipualted and rendered locally, 
    no connection with the server. This makes it very fast. States can only be used 
    in React Components.

    you need an initial value when making a state, and a way too change it.

    ** import useStates to use react hooks, this allows you to use states in functional
    components

    const [count, setCount] = useState(0) // this is array destructing

        useState(0) is our initial value. we always need an initial value for 
        states.
