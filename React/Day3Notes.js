/*
    React Day 3

    class component
    -Has its own private data / states

    send the props to the super constructor

    props is an object
    
    states is also an object

    props get passed between components, but states cannot pass values between components
    is this why we use react context api / redux??????

    class needs a render() function to return the value back to root app
