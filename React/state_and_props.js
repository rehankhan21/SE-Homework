    How to change a parent component state from a child component?
    - You can pass a method from the parent component to the child compoent,
    this method can then take a argument from the child compoenent and pass it back
    to the parent component then the parent componenet can take this new data as the
    methods parameter and use setState to change the value of the parent compoenent
    with whatever value was passed by the child component.
